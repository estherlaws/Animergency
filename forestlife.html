          The Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), was officially classified as endangered in 1990 because their population was at exactly 1,114. In 2016, the population had increased by 70, so their status was changed to vulnerable, but now, due to climate change, it is predicted that the Panda will be extinct by 2025.

        <p>
          The Northern Owl (Strix Occidentalis Caurina), is one of three spotted owl subspecies, and is native to the Pacific Northwest. These gorgeous birds were first acknowledged as endangered in 1990. Since then, there have been logging restrictions put into place to protect the remaining 3,000-5,000.

        <p>
          Orangutan (Pongo), reside solely in the rain forests of the Southeast Asian Islands, specifically the islands located in Borneo and Sumatra. The majority of their times are spent in the trees, which also leads me to their biggest threat: deforestation. The close-second biggest threat to these great apes is due to hunting. As of present day, their population is at a heart-wrenching 104,700.

        <p>
          The Tongus Snub-Nosed Monkey (Rhinopithecus avunculus), will be the earliest discovered species on this website. With their natural habitat being in the forests of Vietnam, unfortunately, are endangered due to the poaching for food, and the destruction of their habitats. They are also classified as one of the world's most endangered primate species with only 200 remaining.
