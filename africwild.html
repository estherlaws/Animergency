          The Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), has been the holder of the title: "The world's fastest land animal." With
          speeds up to 70mph, these beautiful mammals have been on the brink of extinction for the past 10,000 to 12,000
          years; approximately since the last Ice Age. Today, there are less than 8,000 African Cheetas left.

        <p>
          The Rhinoceros (Rhinocerotidae), residing in Africa and the Southeast of Asia, have been endangered since the
          beginning of the 1900s. By 1970, their populus dropped to 70,000, and as of present day, approximately only
          27,000 Rhinos have survived. The largest cause for their demise has been because of poachers.

        <p>
          The Elephant (Loxodonta), saw a staggering decrease in their population between the 1800-1900s. As of 2022,
          there are approximately 415,000 "Tuskers" remaining. Just like the Rhinoceros, their biggest threat have been
          poachers who sell their tusks for the ivory trade.

        <p>
          The Dama Gazelle (Nanger Dama), are one of the most critically endangered species listed on this website. With
          their population estimated to be 400, their biggest threat to their existence has been due to hunting, and
          also the loss of their natural habitats, being savannas and grasslands, to other dangerous, and dominating
          species.
