                    The Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia Mydas), have been endangered officially since 1978, although their
                    population has been on the decline over the last century. The loss of their habitat remains as one
                    of the biggest threats to their existence, along with the illegal trading market.

                    The Hammerhead Shark (Sphyrnidae), known for their unique and humorous shape, have resided primarily
                    in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocenas, as well as the Mediterranean sea. Officially endangered
                    since 2006, their population is below 200. They are threatened by "commercial fishing" for the sale
                    on the shark fin trade market.

                    The Monk Seal (Monachini), are mostly threatened by toxoplasmosis; an infection of a parasite. With
                    their population at a staggering 1,500, he result of their potential extinction would cost the
                    Hawaiian ecosystem greatly as they play a powerful role in the food chain. As an apex predator, they
                    are heavily relied on to keep crustacean, fish, and squid populations from becoming out of control.

                    The Chilean Dolphin (Cephalorhynchus eutropia), residing in Chile, has not been seen in over 20
                    years, however, there are approximately 5,000 still living. Approximately 1,500 are killed a year
                    for the use of bait for swordfishing and crab fisheries.
